Med API

The aim of this tool is to provide patients with a frictionless ordering experience for durable medical equipment (DME).
This tool is intended to function as an API sitting between prescribers, suppliers, and insurance companies--enabling these entities to automatically determine coverage eligibility, requirements (e.g. prior auth), costs, and billing.
